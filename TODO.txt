ScanChannelsBDA ToDo list

- detect demod device between tuner and capture device
- Install DxSDK 9.0c
- keep a list of transponders so that the correct transponder is used for services
- Change DisplayName in FilterGraphTools to DevicePath
- Include Teletext PIDs after the channel number
- Use manually entered frequency if doesn't match by +-3500
- Put an IsAlreadyScanning check in ServiceChanged to stop multiple events causing
  two scans to run side by side.

- replace linked lists with vectors
