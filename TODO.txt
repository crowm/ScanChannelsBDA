- Install DxSDK 9.0c
- keep a list of transponders so that the correct transponder is used for services
- Include Teletext PIDs after the channel number
- Use manually entered frequency if doesn't match by +-3500
- Implement proper list of streams (rather than having a list of mp2 streams and only one video and ac3 stream)
- replace linked lists with vectors


Recompile DW 0.724 with DXSDK 9.0c
